Write all C++ code strictly according to the C++ Core Guidelines and Google C++ Style Guide.
Enforce RAII, const-correctness, ownership clarity, and zero memory/resource leaks.
Apply proven system design patterns and clean architecture principles. Follow modularity approach and minimum coupling.
Use Test-Driven Development: provide unit tests first for all new functionality.
Avoid magic numbers, strings, and implicit assumptions — everything must be named, explicit, and justified.
Prefer readability, determinism, and maintainability over brevity or cleverness.
If a design trade-off exists, explain it briefly before coding.
